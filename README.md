# Ammar Kheder

PhD student in AI for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics  
📍 Based in Finland | 🧠 Researcher | 💻 Python Enthusiast

I work at the intersection of environmental science, deep learning, and scientific visualization.  
My focus is on building models to understand and predict air pollution dynamics, and exploring how mathematics can generate art.

## 🔬 Featured Projects

### [🌀 Fractals — Code-Generated Infinite Geometry](https://github.com/AmmarKheder/fractals)

Each week, I publish a new fractal created entirely with Python.  
Some are purely mathematical (Mandelbrot, Julia, Burning Ship), others are data-driven — using real-world variables like PM2.5 levels to control the visual output.

### [🌫 AQ-Net — Deep Spatio-Temporal Model for Air Pollution](https://github.com/AmmarKheder/AQ-Net)

A neural network designed for air quality reanalysis, combining:
- Temporal modeling (LSTM + Attention)
- Spatial interpolation (neural kNN)
- Cyclic time encoding  
Tested on 5 years of PM2.5 data across northern China.
