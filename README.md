# Ammar Kheder

I am currently pursuing a PhD at the Atmospheric Modeling Centre (AMC) in Lahti, in collaboration with LUT University and the University of Helsinki. My project focuses on developing a neural network-based emulator to improve air quality and Earth system models. By integrating advanced Al algorithms and detailed chemical mechanisms, the aim is to overcome the limitations of traditional models and enhance the accuracy of environmental predictions at both regional and global scales.

##  Featured Projects

### [🌀 Fractals — Code-Generated Infinite Geometry](https://github.com/AmmarKheder/fractals)

Each week, I publish a new fractal created entirely with Python.  
Some are purely mathematical (Mandelbrot, Julia, Burning Ship), others are data-driven — using real-world variables like PM2.5 levels to control the visual output.

### [🌫 AQ-Net — Deep Spatio-Temporal Model for Air Pollution](https://github.com/AmmarKheder/AQ-Net)

AQ-Net is a deep learning architecture for air quality **reanalysis and forecasting**, based on both spatial and temporal components.  
It was developed as part of my research and has been **accepted for publication at SCIA 2025**.

📄 [Read the paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11941)

**Abstract**:  
AQ-Net is a deep learning-based model designed for air quality reanalysis in both spatial and temporal domains.  
The model leverages an LSTM combined with multi-head attention to capture temporal dependencies, while a neural kNN module provides spatial interpolation for unobserved monitoring stations.  
An innovative cyclic encoding (CE) technique is also introduced to ensure continuous time representation, overcoming issues with discrete time boundaries.  
Tested on five years of PM2.5 data over northern China, AQ-Net shows strong performance in both short-term (6–24 hours) and long-term (up to 7 days) forecasting.

### [ Pokémon Card Detection](https://github.com/AmmarKheder/pokemoncards)

A web demo and model for automatic **Pokémon card recognition** using computer vision.

This project identifies and extracts key information from **Base Set Pokémon cards**.  
Originally trained on French Base Set 2 cards, the model generalizes well to English versions and other Base Set variants.

- OCR & layout-based parsing for card text, name, type, and stats  
- Image processing pipeline built in Python  
- Web demo for testing with uploaded card images  
- Useful for collectors, archivists, or hobbyists
