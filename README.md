# Ammar Kheder

I am currently pursuing a PhD at the Atmospheric Modeling Centre (AMC) in Lahti, in collaboration with LUT University and the University of Helsinki. My project focuses on developing a neural network-based emulator to improve air quality and Earth system models. By integrating advanced Al algorithms and detailed chemical mechanisms, the aim is to overcome the limitations of traditional models and enhance the accuracy of environmental predictions at both regional and global scales.

## 🔬 Featured Projects

### [🌀 Fractals — Code-Generated Infinite Geometry](https://github.com/AmmarKheder/fractals)

Each week, I publish a new fractal created entirely with Python.  
Some are purely mathematical (Mandelbrot, Julia, Burning Ship), others are data-driven — using real-world variables like PM2.5 levels to control the visual output.

### [🌫 AQ-Net — Deep Spatio-Temporal Model for Air Pollution](https://github.com/AmmarKheder/AQ-Net)

A neural network designed for air quality reanalysis, combining:
- Temporal modeling (LSTM + Attention)
- Spatial interpolation (neural kNN)
- Cyclic time encoding  
Tested on 5 years of PM2.5 data across northern China.
